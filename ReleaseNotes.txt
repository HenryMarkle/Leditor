- Fixed dimensions in the dimensions editor not updating.
- Added Small Pipes, Trash, Chaotic Stone, and Random Machines material pre-render.
  - Note: Small Pipes material, when rendering palletes, does not remotely reflect the final result. 

- Fixed the option to place geo features outbounds.
- Fixed tiles-as-props not being detected properly.
- Fixed loading issues of old levels.
- Undefined tiles/materials are now logged.
- Renamed some of tiles textures to match their init names (Linux is case-sensitive with file names).
- Level loading has been made more fault-tolerant.
