### Ropes

- When placing ropes, you need to place each end of the rope sequentially.
  - The new rope will be simulated while doing so.
  - The segment count will adapt depending on the distance between the two ends.

- When selecting a single rope, it gets be simulated automatically.
  - Simulation can still be paused from the window.

- Do note that the dynamic segment count is not optimal (yet), and you may need to manually edit it later.

- Added two new keyboard shortcuts to decrement and increment segment count (`J` and `K` respectively).
