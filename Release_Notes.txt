### Effects Editor

- The new effect button is now named "New Effect", and now takes the entire width of the window.
- The buttons, `delete`, `shift up`, and `shift down` are now always visible.
- Hovering on those buttons will display their shortcuts as tooltips.

### Tiles Editor

- The specs window has now been separated into two windows: specs and textures.

### Rendering

- Fixed a bug that saved the level anyway, even the cancel button was clicked in the save file dialog.
- Added an auto-save prior to rendering.
  - When enabled, if the project was newly created and not saved yet, attempting to render the level will temporaily redirect the user to the save file dialog screen.
