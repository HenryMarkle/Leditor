### Layer 4 Maker

Introducing the Layer 4 Maker.
Contrary to popular belief, there's no such thing as a fourth layer in Rain World. However, an image can be set in the background to give the illusion of distant terrain.
While making the image is possible, this feature was introduced to make it more accessible to construct the image with the game's tiles and geometry.

- The level is rendered in shades of gray.
  - The further the layer, the dimmer it becomes.
  - The closer the layer, the brighter it becomes.

- You can move around the quad points of each layer separately.
- You can disable individual layers.
- Generated images are exported to the new `l4` folder.
