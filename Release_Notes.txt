## Multi-level support (experimental)

- It's possible to load more than one level at once.
  - A new window is added to manage loaded levels.
  - A new option is added to load new levels as tabs or replace existing ones.
  - Two new shortcuts are added to navigate between loaded levels (not bound by default).

## Other changes

- Removed the quick saving screen and is replaced with a throbber text in the lower left to the screen, to be less desruptive.
