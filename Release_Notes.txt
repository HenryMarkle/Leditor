- Fixed a load error when attempting to load a level without props.
- Fixed a load problem when tiles are saved with negative numbers.
- Fixed navigation not being locked when typing in project name in the save dialog.
- Hopefully fixed the render button taking the user to the save dialog even if the project was loaded and not created.
