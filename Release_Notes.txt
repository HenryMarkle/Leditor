## Drizzle Update (Part Two)

- Added custom rope/long prop support.
 - Custom ropes/longs follow the same format as their reqular counterparts. 
 - To add custom ropes, append your custom rope into the `Props/Init.txt` with the following format: `[#nm:"Diagonal Chain", #tp:"customRope", #colorTreatment:"bevel", #bevel:1, #depth:3, #pixelSize:point(24, 32), #segmentLength:13, #repeatL:[2, 2], #vars:1, #random:0, #tags:[], #notes:[], #collisionDepth:3, #segRad:6.5, #grav:0.88, #friction:0.7, #airFric:0.9, #stiff:1, #previewColor:color(53, 110, 134), #previewEvery:3, #edgeDirection:0, #rigid:0.2, #selfPush:3.2, #sourcePush:0]`
 - To add custom longs, append your custom long into the `Props/Init.txt` with the following format: `[#nm:"LongTest", #tp:"customLong", #colorTreatment:"standard", #depth:2, #pixelSize:point(10, 20), #segmentLength:20, #repeatL:[1,1,1], #vars:1, #random:0, #tags:["effectColorA"], #notes:[]]`
