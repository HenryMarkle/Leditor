This feature is not tested.

## Notice on "Seamless Voxel Struct" Tile Type

Support was added for the following new tile types: "voxelStructSeamlessHorizontal" and "voxelStructSeamlessVertical", allowing for the tiles of these types to be accepted and rendered. 
However, no further support is given as I don't know how they work yet.

## End-of-Life Notice

I have forgotten to announce EOL, last release, therefor I'm doing it now. This project is no longer in active development and no future updates shall be anticipated.
