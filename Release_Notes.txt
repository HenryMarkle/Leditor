- Added undo action to the light editor.
    - `CTRL + Z` to undo.
    - `CTRL + SHIFT + Z` to redo.
    - By default, you can undo up to 30 actions.

- If `/assets/renderer/Props` and `/assets/renderer/Graphics` are missing, the editor now provides an option to download them automatically, either from Solar's repo or Slime_Cubed's.

- Fixed a crash that is caused by attempting to paste from clipboard.
