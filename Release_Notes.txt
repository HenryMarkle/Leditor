## Mirror Tool

Added a tool that mirrors your cursor's actions in the geometry editor.

- Mirror vertically or horizontally.
- Mirrors can be moved using mouse or keyboard.
- When both mirrors are enabled, a fourth cursor could be enabled.
- Cursors can be labeled.
- New shortcuts added to toggle and move mirrors.
 - By default, press V to toggle vertical mirror and H to toggle horizontal mirror.
 - Shortcuts to move mirrors are not bound by default.

- A new window added to configure mirrors in the geometry editor.
 - Configuration does not persist after closing the program.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the `Don't Show Again` checkbox, in the textures dailog message, when tile textures are still loading.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when attempting to paste tiles into layer 3.
