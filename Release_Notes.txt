- Added a new props presets option
  - Select the props you want to save as a preset
  - Press SHIFT + Y to save
  - They'll appear in the new `presets` window
  - The feature is not 100% finished; expect bugs and potential crashes.
  - This option is opt-in; you need to enable the presets window in the settings.
- Prop placement stuck to long/rope prop placement mode has been mostly fixed.
